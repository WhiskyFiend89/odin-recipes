			<h2>Authentic Bolognese Sauce</h2>
			<p>
				Authentic Bolognese sauce is serious business! One of the most popular
				Italian condiments, this sauce is absolutely bursting with real tomato
				flavour thanks to the slow cooking process and minimal seasoning
				required.
			</p>
			<p>
				Make way for these authentic flavours on your plate and stop adding
				unnecessary flavours. This is one recipe to have on repeat.
			</p>
			<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>1 x red/brown onion chopped</li>
				<li>3 x celery stalks chopped</li>
				<li>3 x carrots chopped</li>
				<li>500g/17.6oz pork mince</li>
				<li>300g/10.5oz beef mince</li>
				<li>200g/7.05oz veal mince</li>
				<li>1L/4.2 cups Italian tomato passata</li>
				<li>400g/14.1oz peeled tomatoes</li>
				<li>150g/5.29oz tomato paste</li>
				<li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
				<li>1 x glass white wine</li>
				<li>1 x mug full cream milk</li>
				<li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
				<li>1-2L water (to be boiled using the kettle)</li>
			</ul>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Authentic Bolognese sauce starts with a soffrito, so place a large pot
					on your stove (medium heat), add a generous amount of extra virgin
					olive oil and once warm, add onion.
				</li>
				<li>
					When the onion begins to look glossy and golden, add carrots, celery
					and then stir through, leaving to cook for 4-5 minutes.
				</li>
				<li>
					Next add ½ glass white wine (118ml) to the authentic Bolognese sauce
					and leave to simmer on low for a few minutes or until the wine
					evaporates.
				</li>
				<li>
					Add the mince and break it down using a wooden spoon and/or fork
					before seasoning with only salt and pepper.
				</li>
				<li>
					Mix every so often to ensure the mince is all cooked through, leaving
					to brown.
				</li>
				<li>
					Once the water has evaporated, mix in the other half glass of white
					wine.
				</li>
				<li>
					In total, authentic Bolognese sauce should cook for up to 4-5hr and
					this will make the meat more tender.
				</li>
				<li>
					After allowing the wine to evaporate again, mix through the passata,
					paste and peeled tomatoes.
				</li>
				<li>Crush tomatoes using the wooden spoon as you stir through.</li>
				<li>
					After 1.5hr, add 1L/4.2cups boiled water to the pot and mix through.
					At this point, taste for salt – this is a preference of taste, add
					only if you want more as no other seasoning is necessary for an
					authentic Bolognese sauce!
				</li>
				<li>
					Then after another hour or so, add more – the trick is when the sauce
					looks dry, add water, this will thicken the mixture and allow the
					mince to become more tender.
				</li>
				<li>
					Allow the sauce to bubble only a small amount and not spurt
					everywhere. If it is bubbling too much, turn the heat down.
				</li>
				<li>
					When the sauce is 1/2 hr away from being ready, boil 5L water in a
					second pot then add a tablespoon of rock salt, leaving it to dissolve.
				</li>
				<li>
					Once the sauce has been cooking for up to 5hr, remove it from the heat
					and leave to rest.
				</li>
				<li>
					Add your choice of pasta to the water (mine is Pappardelle) and cook
					according to the packet instructions.
				</li>
				<li>While the pasta is boiling, prepare a large fry pan for mixing!</li>
				<li>
					Next add a cup of full cream milk to your sauce and stir through then
					put it back on the stove for 5 minutes.
				</li>
				<li>
					Finally, place a frypan on the stove at a low heat, and add a generous
					spoonful (or two!) of Bolognese sauce, covering the base.
				</li>
				<li>
					Next, add the strained pasta into the pan along with a cup of pasta
					water.
				</li>
				<li>
					Mix this through until the pasta is completely lathered before adding
					another generous amount of authentic Bolognese sauce and mix again.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>How to Serve:</h3>
			<p>
				Authentic Bolognese sauce should be mixed with a thick pasta like
				pappardelle or tagliatelle so the sauce can be absorbed well. Once
				plated add freshly grated parmigianno regianno cheese. Serve and enjoy!
